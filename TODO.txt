// TODO Use Dynamic imports and lazy loading later along with other optimization techniques (All in one commit):
    Component & Code Optimizations:
    React.memo, React.lazy, Suspense, dynamic import()

    Hooks-Based Optimizations:
    useMemo, useCallback, useRef, useLayoutEffect

    Performance Techniques:
    Debouncing, Throttling, List virtualization, Code splitting, Tree shaking, Image lazy loading, Minimize re-renders

    State Management Best Practices:
    Lift state only when needed, Colocate state, Avoid unnecessary global state, useReducer

    Other Optimizations:
    Bundle analyzer, Preloading, Prefetching, Service workers, Avoid anonymous functions in JSX

// Make sure all appropriate states,props,etc. have types defined

// Refactore items like div,etc to use Material UI items like Box (if applicable)
